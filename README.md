Therefore, Jed McCaled founded Codecoin in early 2016, his bitcoin source code optimization deep they join in their design by Economics principle and use of encryption algorithm. More testing and code review is the bottleneck of the development; we get more requests than we can see and pull test in a short time. Please be patient, ask for help by introducing the test of other people, and remember that this is any error is an important safety project the person may cost a lot of money.

Core / Distributed Array
